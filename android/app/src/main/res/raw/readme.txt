To complete the alert system setup, place an alert sound file here named "alert.mp3" or "notification.wav".

This sound file will be used for critical Zabbix alert notifications that need to wake up the phone and get the user's attention.

Recommended characteristics:
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Duration: 2-5 seconds
- Volume: Clear and audible
- Tone: Distinctive alert sound

The notification service is already configured to use this sound file when available.
