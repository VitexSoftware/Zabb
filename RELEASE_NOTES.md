# Release Notes - Zabb v0.6.1

**Release Date:** April 24, 2026

## Bug Fixes & Code Quality

### Fixed
- **BuildContext safety** — all usages of `BuildContext` across async gaps now properly guard
  with `mounted` / `context.mounted` checks or pre-capture `Navigator`/`ScaffoldMessenger`
  before the `await`. Prevents rare crashes when a widget is unmounted mid-operation.
- **Browse Files sound picker** — selecting a custom audio file via the file browser was
  silently discarded because the dialog was dismissed before the file picker returned. The
  double-pop is removed; the dialog now closes once with the selected path.
- **Invalid `@override`** on `_notificationSubscription` field removed (would suppress
  compile warnings about missing override contracts).
- **Unused `SecurityContext` import** removed from `zabbix_api.dart`.

### Improved
- Replaced all `print()` calls with `debugPrint()` so debug output is suppressed in release
  builds and respects the Flutter log level.
- Removed three dead private methods that had no callers:
  `_showNotificationConfigScreen`, `_selectSoundFile(BuildContext)`,
  `_buildSeveritySwitches`.

### Tests
- Fixed `widget_test.dart`: SharedPreferences was not mocked, causing the `FutureBuilder`
  to stay in loading state and the `Configure Server` assertion to fail.
- Added routing test: verifies `LoginScreen` is shown when the app is already configured.
